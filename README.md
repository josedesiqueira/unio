# Unio 

> An **open source** web and mobile application that aims to automate the creation, application and management of paper and online multiple choices exams.
> We are looking for collaborators! We need front-end and back-end coders, as UX/UI designers as well. Get in touch with us if you want to contribute to this project. 

**Unio** will be a free plataform to create questions about any subjects, and use the questions in online and paper exams.

With Unio you will be able to:
  - search the immense collection of questions and exams from diferent sources in Unio's database;
  - create your own online exams for study purposes;
  - create as many different exams as you wish with the same questions, by randomizing questions position in the exam, as the alternatives as well,           making cheating more difficult;
  - create user's groups to discuss and share questions and exams with other people;
  - manage your questions and exams, using key words to find them easily, using markers to organize them, as saving questionas and exams search results       in collections as well.
